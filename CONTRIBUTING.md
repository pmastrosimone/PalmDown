## Issues
Open an issue using the Issues tab on GitHub using the template provided (if it exists). Be as specific as possible about the issue you are having. However, as of April 2021, the project is still in the "extremely unfinished" state, so certain things will not work or may not be implemented yet. Use the "todo' and "request" tags in issues to call attention to them. 

## Branches and Pull Requests
When submitting a pull request, ensure that it is as descript as possible: noting what in the code was modified and why. Also ensure that the code was commented enough so that more specifics on what was added/modified can be gathered.  

For example:
> PalmDownVFS.h added new function saveFile to handle saving files on a VFS card

## Testing and Environment
Currently, the code is primarily tested in Palm OS Emulator (POSE), using a Palm OS 4.1.2 ROM from an m515. More testing will need to be done on OS5/HiRes devices in the future; however getting the program working on this platform comes before OS5/HiRes support. The recommended IDE for this project is Metrowerks CodeWarrior for Palm OS 9.3, the .mcp and .cww files in the repo are included for those who want them. (These files are not required to use CodeWarrior, and should not be necessary for building).

## Code of Conduct
Just be mindful of others, not everyone is gonna be a world-class programmer; and some (myself included) consider programming a hobby and nothing more. If you have a disagreement with someone, handle it before it turns into a petty conflict, and don't take it personally.
